== The rules for setup and scenarios

Here you'll find guidance and ideas on how to set up a game of {project-name}.
You'll also find scenario special rules; these are particular to some scenarios, so we detail them here rather than in the _Core_ component.

Topics that we cover here include:

* How to select a scenario and decide what armies to use.
* How to set up a scenario and terrain for the playing area.
* Fate cards -- what they are and how to use them in your games.
* How to deploy your armies and how to begin and end the game.
* Scenario special rules and how to apply them to your games.
* How to play through multiple scenarios as a campaign.
