* How to set up a scenario and terrain for the playing area.
* Fate cards -- what they are and how to use them in your games.
* How to deploy your forces and how to begin and end the game.
* Scenario special rules and how to apply them to your games.
* How to play through multiple scenarios as a campaign.
