= Battles

So â€” you've got your armies together, you've read the rules and you're ready for a game. In order to play a game the players must do a bit of preparation first. Here's the check list:

* Pick a scenario, and decide who will be the attacker and who will be the defender, if this is required by the scenario.
* Sort out the troops that make up the armies.
* Set up the terrain on the wargames table.
* Deploy the armies.
* Fight the battle!
