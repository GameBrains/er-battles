[TIP]
====
Custom Army Morale modifiers can be particularly useful in a campaign.
For example:

* An army that faces an enemy that has defeated it many times before might suffer a penalty to its Army Morale value at the start of the game, or at the end of each turn.
* A desperate army that has rallied behind a legendary hero might have benefit from a boost to its Army Morale value.
* Particular detachments or objectives might afford a larger modifier than usual, to represent their special importance.
