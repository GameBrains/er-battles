= Daemon world terrain

A daemon world is a planet that has been corrupted and warped by the power of Chaos and the Warp.
This is the typical fate of planets that become trapped in a prolonged Warp rift.

These worlds exist as bizarre realms where the laws of physics break down and powerful daemonic entities shape the environment to suit their whims.
