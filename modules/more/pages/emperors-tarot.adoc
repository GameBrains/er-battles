== The Astropath/Psychic Blast (3)

|===
|Original |New

|*EXCUTERIA ARCANA: THE ASTROPATH*

_"The eyes of the blind lead you."_

You may make an attack on an enemy detachment anywhere on the table.
Roll 3D6 to determine the firepower of the attack.
Any hits are allocated by your opponent.

*Play this card in the shooting phase instead of nominating a detachment to fire.*

|*Excuteria Arcana: The Astropath*

_"The eyes of the blind lead you."_

*You may play this card in the Shooting phase, when it is your turn to choose a detachment to shoot with.*

#TODO: The Shooting phase has two parts, 'Shoot with vehicles and infantry' and 'Shoot with war engines' — we probably ought to make it explicit whether or not the player can use this card in either part or only in the first part.#

Choose an enemy detachment anywhere in the area of play.
Resolve an attack with Firepower 3D6 -- like a shooting attack, except that your opponent allocates your hits.

#Is there room for argument here? I mean, given how the hit allocation rules changed and how this allocation is necessarily different to directed shooting, do we need to make it explicit that the opponent may not 'waste' hits by allocating high scores to low Armour value units and vice-versa? Do we need to add to the hit allocation rules to explain this 'opponent allocates un-directed hits' situation which comes up with a couple of Fate cards?#

|Original |New

_"Serve with an unconquerable mind."_

Play on an enemy detachment.
The detachment has its firepower halved this phase.

*Play this card at the start of any phase.*

|*Excuteria Arcana: The Magus*

_"Serve with an unconquerable mind."_

*You may play this card at the start of any phase.*

Choose an enemy detachment.
Halve the Firepower total of this detachment until the end of this phase.

#I'm not 100% sure how best to phrase this, but I think that any _total_ the detachment would make is the real point here, and this would also force rolls to lock on with any super-heavy weapons it has. (Although, what if they are already being halved and now we're halving again?)#

== The Daemon/?

|Original |New

|*DISCORDIA ARCANA: THE DAEMON*

_"For the Daemon begets despair."_

Play on a Chaos daemon detachment.
The entire detachment has its Save ability reduced to the roll of a 6 for the
rest of the turn.

*Play this card at any time.*

|*Discordia Arcana: The Daemon*

_"For the Daemon begets despair."_

*Play this card at any time, on a Chaos Daemon detachment.*

For the rest of this turn, the {save} ability of every Daemon unit in the detachment requires a roll of 6 to ignore a hit, rather than the usual 4+.

#TODO: I think we need to be more precise. I assume we really mean any unit in the Chaos Daemon infantry data sheets table, rather than only units that we derive from the Daemon unit data sheet -- but at present it is ambiguous. Was there talk of a distinct _Daemon_ ability, to incorporate {Save} and something else? If so then it'd be easy to tweak the text above to reference this ability specifically.#

_"Fierce rages the Kraken o' the deep."_

*You may play this card at the start of the turn, on a Tyranid army detachment.*

For the rest of this turn, this Tyranid detachment cannot benefit from the {unbreakable} ability rules, so your opponent must take Leadership tests as normal.

#I'm not sure about how best to word this. In part because one might argue that it should cancel {synapse}, but I've assumed that the {dauntless} part of {synapse} should still apply.#
