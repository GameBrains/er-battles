Play on a war engine within 30cm of one of your psykers.
One weapon system or battery on the war engine counts as being on Overwatch orders for its next shot.

*Play this card at any time.*

|*Guide*

*You may play this card at any time.*

Choose one of your War Engine units that is within 30 cm of one of your {psyker} units.
Declare a weapon system on this war engine.
For your next shooting attack with this weapon system, re-roll any misses you roll with the hit dice.

#{blank}[TODO: The original references Overwatch. Are there any edge cases where thi is actually important? If not then a think that a straightforward statement about the re-rolls for shooting is better.]#

== Temporal Distort/Sustain Attack

|===
|Original |New

|*TEMPORAL DISTORT*

When this card is played the Eldar player may choose to re-draw the initiative in each phase for the remainder of the turn.
Initiative counters are put back into the cup and re-drawn again.
Initiative counters may only be re-drawn once per phase.

*Play this card before rolling for reserves.*

|*Temporal Distort*

*Play this card in the Start phase, before the _Roll for Reserves_ step.*

For the rest of this turn, at each _Determine the Initiative_ step, you may choose to re-draw the Initiative counter.
If you do this, put all of the Initiative counters back into the mug and then re-draw.
You must accept the new result, and no effect can force a counter to be redrawn more than once.

#{blank}[TODO: The original text phrases this ability on the bases of phases. I've assumed that the real intent was to allow redraw at each _Determine the Initiative_ step -- of which there are two in the Shooting phase.]#

== Webway/Sustain Attack

|Original |New

|*WEBWAY*

All rolls for reserves this turn are successful on a score of 2+ regardless of the detachment's speed and the turn count.

*Play this card before rolling for reserves.*

|*Webway*

*Play this card in the Start phase, before the _Roll for Reserves_ step.*

This turn, each of your rolls for Reserves are successful on a score of 2+, regardless of the detachment's speed and the turn count.

#{blank}[TODO: The original text was ambiguous -- it could be read to imply that BOTH sides get the same advantage from this card. That can't have been intended as it wouldn't fit the context, so I've made it plain that only the card-holder benefits. However, in the event of a mixed force, shouldn't this effect apply only to Eldar detachments?]#
