|*ORBTAL BARRAGE*

|*Orbital Barrage*

Choose one enemy detachment, anywhere in the playing area.
Make a single attack against it, with a Firepower total of 3D6.

In this special case, your opponent should allocate the hits.

#{blank}[TODO: Hmmm. Do we need to say something more about how this should work? I guess this special case came about largely because there is no direction for the attack to decide 'nearest' units for allocation -- so in this case the target player gets to allocate as they prefer without regard to 'nearest', though still subject to the other restrictions (like no second hit on units until they've allocated a first hit to every unit).]#
