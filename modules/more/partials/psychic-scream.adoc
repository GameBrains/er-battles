_A Tyranid psyker channels the full might of the Hive Mind to assail all nearby enemy psykers._

*You may play this card at any time.*

Each enemy {psyker} unit that is within 45 cm of one of your Tyranid {psyker} units takes a hit, unless your opponent plays a Psychic Attack card of equal or higher value, to nullify your attack.
