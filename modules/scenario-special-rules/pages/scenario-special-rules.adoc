= Scenario special rules

These rules cover unusual situations that apply in some scenarios and not in others.

Like the special rules in the Core rules component, you don't need to learn all of the scenario special rules at once.
Just familiarise yourself with the rules that apply in the specific scenario that you intend to play.

TIP: If you like to invent your own scenarios, don't be afraid to modify or add to these rules.
This can be a great way to bring the theme of your scenario to life and to create interesting new challenges.
Just remember that it's best to keep it simple -- a little can go a long way, and you don't want complexity to spoil the fun.
