== Maps

* Standard deployment edges.
* No deployment zones.
* A river, with two bridges over it.
+
TIP: The exact size and style of the two bridges doesn't matter â€” just use whatever you have in your terrain collection.
Or, if you lack suitable river and bridge terrain pieces, just improvise them -- use scissors to cut suitable shapes from spare cloth, card or paper.

== Setup

. Place a wide river with two bridges across it, as we show at <<Maps>>.
Place the bridges such that each of the two armies can reach the bridge that is nearest to them in the first turn.
. xref:get-ready-to-play:set-up-terrain.adoc[Set up terrain] in the rest of the playing area in the standard way.

== Disposition of forces

Determine the disposition of your forces.

. Place all of your Flyer detachments in xref:scenario-special-rules:reserves.adoc[Reserves].
. If you have any detachments that qualify for the Reserves rules on their own merit, place them in Reserves.
. Keep all of your other detachments at hand for your initial deployment.

== Initial deployment

include::partial$edge-deployment-procedure.adoc[]

== Play the game

Start the game in the usual way: Proceed to the Start phase.

The Sulphur River is highly corrosive, so it is impassable terrain for all ground units (except at the bridges, of course).

== Game length and victory conditions

The goal is to control both bridges.
To control a bridge, you must have at least one of your units on the bridge, and no enemy units.

The game lasts D3+3 turns.
{blank}[TODO: When exactly should we make this roll? Before or after deployment?]

When the game ends, determine the result as follows:

* If a player controls both bridges, then this player wins a major victory.
* If a player controls one bridge and disputes the other, then this player achieves a minor victory.
* If the opposing players each control one bridge, or dispute both bridges, then the result is a draw.

[NOTE.option]
.Victory or Death!
====
For a real bloodbath, if both players agree, ignore the limit of D3+3 turns.
Instead, play this scenario for as many turns as it takes until one player can claim victory by virtue of the fact that their opponent has no units left!

[NOTE.option]
.Historical variant
====
Bridges are often of great strategic and tactical importance, so battles to control them are common.

For a simple variation that can represent other historical battles, if both players agree, simply allow the Space Marines to use the Drop Pods rules to deploy.

{blank}[TODO: This doesn't really make sense as a variation with the listed historical forces, as each of the Space Marine detachments includes vehicles that are not allowed in drop pods (and not just Rhino transport vehicles). I guess either we're supposed to ignore this, or we ignore the given historical lists. It's a bit of an oversight in the original.]
