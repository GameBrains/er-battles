= Scenarios

These rules give you step-by-step instructions for how to set up and play battles of many different types.

We recommend that you start with the simplest scenarios and with small forces that don't specify many special rules.
As you become more fluent with the rules and gameplay, then gradually try more complex scenarios, bigger forces and more special rules.

The step-by-step instructions in these scenarios are meant to make the scenarios as easy to understand and use as possible.
footnote:[{e40k-diff}
{project-name} versions of {e40k} scenarios contain more text than the originals -- but, you should find them much easier to understand and use.
The original versions mix instructions and omit information to the extent that they can be quite difficult to interpret.

But of course you should feel free to adapt the scenarios or invent new ones, if you want to.
