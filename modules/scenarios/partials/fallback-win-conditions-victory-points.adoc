If this hasn't happened by the end of the 6^th^ turn, or if both players' Army Morale values drop to 0 or less on the same turn, then calculate victory points as follows:

* Each player scores 2 victory points for each Take & Hold or Cleanse objective they control.
* The Attacker scores 1 victory point for any other objectives they achieved during the game.
{blank}[TODO: Should this be 'each other objective', rather than 'any'? The original text "The attacker scores a bonus point for any other objectives" could imply only a single point for *one or more* achieved objectives, but I don't think that this was the intent?]
* The Defender scores 1 victory point for each other objective that the Attacker did not achieve during the game.

The player with the most victory points is the winner.
