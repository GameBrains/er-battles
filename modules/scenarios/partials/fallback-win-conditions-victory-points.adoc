If this hasn't happened by the end of the 6^th^ turn, or if both players' Army Morale values drop to 0 or less on the same turn, then calculate victory points as follows:

* Each player scores 2 victory points for each Take & Hold or Cleanse objective they control.
* The Attacker scores 1 victory point for each other objective that they achieved during the game.
* The Defender scores 1 victory point for each other objective that the Attacker did not achieve during the game.

The player with the most victory points is the winner.
