footnote:[{e40k-diff}
In the original {e40k} texts, some units and detachments don't correlate perfectly with what the army lists allow.
That's not really a problem; but we wanted to offer links to ready-built detachments in the detachment builder for convenience, and these depend on the army list constraints that are built into the detachment builder.
So, where necessary we've deviated very slightly from the originals in favour of compatibility with the Remastered army lists as they exist in the detachment builder.
