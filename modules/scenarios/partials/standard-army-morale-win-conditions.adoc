Standard Army Morale win conditions apply: At the end of the Rally phase, if a player has an Army Morale value of zero or less then the game ends and the other player is the winner.
footnote:[{e40k-diff}
In a strict interpretation of the original text for this scenario, you might end the game as soon as a player's Army Morale value reaches 0, whenever that happens during a game turn.
However, we think it is more consistent with other rules, more fair, and probably the original intent, to complete the turn sequence and determine the overall game state only at step xref:core:main-rules:check-the-game-end-conditions.adoc[], as usual.
So, we've made the text clear in this respect.
